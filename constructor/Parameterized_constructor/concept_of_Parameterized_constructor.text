  The constructor that can take N number of  argument is called parameterized constructor .
  It helps in initializing values of data element when an object is created.
  It is used to initialize the different data elements of different objects with different values when they are created.
  
  The parameterized constructors can be called explicitly or implicitly.
 
  class_name object_name =class_name(10, 50);   // Explicit call
  class_name object_name(10, 50);               // Implicit call
